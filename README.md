## Ideas for Extending the Project

* Make the script run on a timer and deploy it to a server. Have it email you every so often with the CSV report.
* Add more robust error checking so that you can crawl larger sites without issues.
* Count external links, as well as internal links, and add them to the report
* Use a graphics library to create an image that shows the links between the pages as a graph visualization
* Add a README.md file explaining to users how to clone your git repo and get started
